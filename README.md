## üìñ Description

ZK Loans is a decentralized protocol that enables users to access collateral-free loans on Rootstock by leveraging a unique combination of on-chain and off-chain zero-knowledge proofs.

The process begins by verifying off-chain financial data, such as extracting verifiable bank summaries directly from the user‚Äôs email inbox. This is complemented by on-chain proofs, including time travel proofs (which assess historical wallet balances over specific block ranges) and teleport proofs (which evaluate liquidity across multiple blockchain networks).

Once solvency is established, the user undergoes KYC verification to confirm their identity. All proof components ‚Äî both on-chain and off-chain ‚Äî are aggregated to build a cross-chain reputation score. This reputation is relayed using LayerZero to a smart contract on Ethereum Sepolia, which handles creditworthiness assessment and validation.

Finally, a smart contract on Rootstock executes the disbursement of the approved RBTC loan amount. To ensure legal compliance and auditability, an on-chain attestation is generated that records the hash and signature of the signed legal agreement, while the full document is securely stored off-chain for future reference.

## üß™ How to Test the Integration

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup environment variables

These are additional variables **not** included in `.env.example` on the frontend:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_VLAYER_API_TOKEN=
```

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend setup (NestJS)

```bash
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend setup (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
yarn install
yarn dev
```

üéâ Once both servers are running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.  
You should see ZK-Loans live!

## üîó Rootstock Integration

We deployed smart contracts on Rootstock to handle loan disbursement, verify user attestations, and manage on-chain RBTC transfers. The system ensures at least two on-chain testnet transactions, meeting qualification requirements.

**Rootstock Lending Contract Address:**  
`0x31e0A37bda916C0098be8600e6f156D877cb4BA8`

The contract is located in the `vlayer` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è VLayer Integration

We use VLayer‚Äôs Email Proofs to extract and validate bank summaries off-chain, as well as Time Travel and Teleport proofs to validate on-chain liquidity across multiple chains. Both Prover and Verifier contracts are incorporated and linked.

| Proof Type     | Prover Address                                     | Verifier Address                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Time Travel   | `0x51fb4ab6b17bd7f5a18f031369da638ce7b19e30`       | `0x967e74ef3572ea6f8ae0bc3309227945613ad239`      |
| Teleporter    | `0x438cb7d7e09a3cf573315d74afacecc53266d713`       | `0x9ad75d90e0bdb6089fbf849e722367fd5068d915`      |
| Email Proof   | `0x9134a21cb76745cf03e110be834b83e651b39904`       | `0xc647ec40d2937dbf9e3ff8486dd7531af6faa3f4`      |


These contracts are organized in separate subfolders within the `vlayer-contracts` directory.

## üåâ LayerZero Integration

We implemented LayerZero‚Äôs omnichain messaging (OApp) to transmit proof data and cross-chain reputation to the Base Sepolia smart contract. This leverages horizontal composability by triggering follow-up messages on Rootstock after reputation validation.

**Contracts:**  
- Rootstock Lending: `0x31e0A37bda916C0098be8600e6f156D877cb4BA8`  
- Ethereum Sepolia Scoring: `0xFbC66bD8466f7B7628fD32F8a8C07f3976c73979`
